# Operational Data Graphics: Project Brief

## Project Intent
This is a **portfolio project** to demonstrate systems-level design thinking for a Senior Data Graphics Designer / Design Engineer role. This is NOT a production BI tool — it's a visual grammar + implementation proof.

## Target Audience
- Data engineers
- Analytics engineers  
- Infrastructure / platform teams
- Technical PMs

Users who work with time-series, operational metrics, and care about reliability over decoration.

## Core Philosophy
Evoke: **Calm, Precision, Trust, Stability, Restraint**

Avoid: Decorative noise, over-animation, over-saturated color, marketing aesthetics

Think: Infrastructure-grade UI, functional motion, deterministic behavior

## Deliverables
1. **Design thesis** (written philosophy)
2. **Visual foundations** (typography, color, spacing, axis/grid rules)
3. **6 chart primitives** (designed + documented)
4. **4 charts implemented** (Vega/JS/SVG)
5. **Interaction & motion standards**
6. **GitHub repo + case study**

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Philosophy + visual foundations
- **Week 2**: Chart primitives designed
- **Week 3**: Implement 4 charts in Vega
- **Week 4**: Case study + polish demo

## Design Principles
1. Maximize signal, minimize noise
2. Prioritize density over whitespace
3. Use color sparingly and semantically
4. Design for dark mode first
5. Motion must have purpose
6. Accessibility is non-negotiable
7. Consistency builds trust

## Technology
- **Vega / Vega-Lite** for charts
- **SVG** for rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity
- **Figma** for design standards

## What Success Looks Like
- Demonstrates systems thinking
- Shows implementation credibility
- Signals senior-level design expertise
- Clearly different from generic dashboards
- Portfolio-ready in 4 weeks
